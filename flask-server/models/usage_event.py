"""Per-account usage, for plan limit enforcement.

Deliberately its own table rather than a count over ``job``: the frontend starts
runs through ``/run-inference``, which keeps state in an in-memory dict mirrored
to ``sessions/<id>/job.json`` and never writes a ``job`` row. Counting jobs would
therefore see zero for every run a real user makes.

One row per metered action. ``finished_at`` is what makes concurrency
answerable — a null means the run is still in flight, so "how many scans does
this user have going right now" is a count rather than a guess.
